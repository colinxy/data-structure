Data Structure in C++
=====================

This project consists of several mini projects and is intended
for personal practice.

Implements common data structure and algorithms in C++, including:

- linked list
- stack, queue
- recursion: merge-sort, quick-sort, quick-selection
- binary tree, heap
- hash table


### Goals

- gain proficiency with the data-structure and algorithms covered
- practice command line tools and text-based editor, e.g. gdb, emacs
- get familiar with gnu make and c++ compile flags
- get familiar with test driven c++ development


### On Track so far

- A doubly linked list using template
- A singly linked list using template with iterator
- A fixed size integer stack
- A fixed size integer queue
