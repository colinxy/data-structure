Data Structure in C++
=====================

The library implements common and data structure algorithms n C++, including:

- linked list
- stack, queue
- recursion: binary search, mergesort, quicksort, quick-selection
- binary tree, heap
- hash table


Goals

- gain proficency with the data-structure and algorithms covered
- practice command line and text-based editor, e.g. emacs
- get familiar with c++ compile flags
- use a c++ testing framework, e.g. google test
